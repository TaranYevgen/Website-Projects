						being settled in any currency.</p>

					<p>WeChat Pay currently has over 700 million mainland Chinese users with a further 300
						million outside China. It connects overseas vendors directly to Chinese consumers. Usage
						also allows Chinese consumers to transact outside of China - when Chinese customers buy
						goods or services in a foreign country, they can pay merchants simply using WeChat.</p>

					<p>Y2P powers the overseas payment mechanism that enables these merchant transactions
						via WeChat.</p>

					<p>The Wechat Pay solution is efficient, easy to use and accessible, and lowers
						transaction costs. Transactions must be for goods or services payments and are
						pre-funded via the WeChat account.</p>
